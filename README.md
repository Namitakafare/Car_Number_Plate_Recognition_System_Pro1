# Number Plate Recognition System Using OpenCV

Number Plate Recognition System is car license plate identification system made using OpenCV in python. It can be used to detect number plate from video as well as from image.

## Description

**readimage.py:** This file is used to detect number plate from an image file. It wil draw a boundry around the number plate, blur it and show the text for identification.

**readvideo.py:** This file is used to detect number plate from video file. It will draw a boundry around the number plate, blur it and show the text for identification.

**haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml:** This is a trained haaarcascade model by OpenCV for license plate detection. It is used in both files.

**Data:** This folder contains data used in the Project.
